# Farias weather

## Description

I started creating a function to get data just by city, but then at the final, i realized that I needed the lat and lon, to get the 5 days, then I started again, it was more than 20 hours of work, I feel proud when each test works, the first button its the city that a born and the second the city that I live.

## Usage
You can search by a city name, it will show the today's weather, icon, temperature, wind speed and humidity and the nexts 5 days.
